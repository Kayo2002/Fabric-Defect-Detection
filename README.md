# Fabric-Defect-Detection

## Overview
Fabric Defect Detection is a deep learning project that focuses on identifying and classifying fabric defects using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. The model is based on the EfficientNetV2 architecture and is trained on a dataset comprising five classes of fabric defects. The goal is to provide an accurate and efficient solution for quality control in textile manufacturing.

## Key Features
#### Efficient Model: Utilizes EfficientNetV2, a highly efficient and powerful deep learning architecture.
#### Five-Class Classification: Capable of classifying fabric defects into five distinct categories for comprehensive defect analysis.
#### Custom Data Support: Allows users to incorporate their own custom data for fabric defect detection.
#### Training and Evaluation: Provides scripts for training the model, evaluating its performance, and saving the trained model for future use.

## How to Use
To get started, follow the installation instructions and explore the provided scripts for training, evaluation, and using custom data. The project aims to be user-friendly while delivering robust fabric defect detection capabilities.
